### v-sheet  vs v-card

1. v-sheet:

    - This is a foundational component. Think of it as a basic "piece of paper" in the Material Design sense.
    - It provides core styling features like **_elevation (shadows)_**, rounded corners, and background control.
    - It's designed to be a **_low-level_** component, meaning it's often used as a building block for other, more complex components.
    - It's ideal when you need a **_simple_**, customizable *container* with basic Material Design styling.

2. v-card:

    - This is a **_higher-level_** component built upon v-sheet.
    - It adds structure and predefined slots for common card elements, such as:
        - Title
        - Subtitle
        - Text content
        - Action buttons
    - It's designed for presenting information in a **_structured_** and visually appealing **_way*.
    - It's ideal for displaying content like **_articles_**, product listings, or **_user profiles_**.
